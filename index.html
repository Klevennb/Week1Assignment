        <li>According to OnThisDay.com, I was born on the same day baseball player Daryl Strawberry voluntarily <br>entered the Smither Center for Alcohol rehabilitation. Wow!</li>
        <li>I'm colorblind, so I'm not allowed to fly a fighter jet. Sorry Tom Cruise. I can't be your wingman.</li>
        <li>I enjoy writing in my freetime. I inevitably gravitate to Science Fiction and Fantasy.</li>

  <p>“They heard somewhere in that tenantless night a bell that tolled and ceased where no bell was and they rode out on the round dais of the earth which alone was dark and no light to it and which carried their figures and bore them up into the swarming stars so that they rode not under but among them and they rode at once jaunty and circumspect, like thieves newly loosed in that dark electric, like young thieves in a glowing orchard, loosely jacketed against the cold and ten thousand worlds for the choosing.”-Cormac McCarthy, All The Pretty Horses<p>
